## Why learn to code? We have visual scripting!

Yes we do, and honestly you should try that out. Visual scripting is a great addition to Hytale and we know it'll be powerful, but nothing beats the ability of being able to read and write Java code, with the ability to build even more powerful mods and plugins.

<Callout type="info" title="Visual Scripting vs Coding">
  Visual scripting is great for beginners and for simple tasks, but coding allows for more complex and efficient solutions. Learning to code opens up a wider range of possibilities for modding Hytale.

  We will have guides on visual scripting when Hytale releases from Day 1.

## Should everyone trying to mod Hytale learn how to code?

No one should feel like they HAVE to learn to code to make stuff in Hytale. Simon and his team have validated this time and time again with their strives in graph editors and visual scripting. You can change mob behavior, world generation, etc. all with just these tools.

But if you're looking to build more complex things (from utilities to entirely custom server software) that could be used by large scale server networks and big names, you'll want to learn how to code. And that's where this guide comes in...

## Okay, I'm interested. What's to come?

Over the course of these next several lessons you'll learn the basics of coding, how to read documentation, and how to find resources to help you learn more on your own.

The guides themselves will take a very big "bird's-eye view" approach to things and provide links to resources to do the actual coding. This is done because, quite frankly, enough resources exist on how to learn this stuff, it's just the act of finding the right stuff on Google that can be hard. Learning to be able to code without guidance is the goal. The Hytale Modding community is always there to help you, but to become a truly well rounded developer, you'll have to pick up a lot of this stuff just by reading from resources.

<Callout type="info" title="Finding Resources">
  We have created a small Java Basics series to help you get started with the language itself, but beyond that, you'll be expected to find your own resources to learn more. We recommend sites like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/) as great starting points.

Our goal is to teach you how to Mod Hytale, and that will always be our goal. This is the reason we can't teach you everything about Java or programming in general. Instead, we want to give you the tools to be able to learn on your own, so you can continue to grow as a developer even after you've completed our guides.

## Any closing thoughts?

Remember, learning to code is hard. You will trip and fall, but you will be able to get back up. Stay resilient, believe you can make cool stuff, and I promise you success will come. Happy coding!
