Hytale is a voxel-based sandbox RPG game by **Hypixel Studios**, as described on the [Hytale website](https://hytale.com/):

> Set out on an adventure built for both creation and play. Hytale blends the freedom
> of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full
> of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block.

Hytale has been built from the ground up with modding and user-generated content in mind.
The goal of **Hytale Modding** is to provide an excellent resource such that anybody
is able to mod Hytale for themselves, regardless of skill level or specialization.

It is important to note that modding Hytale is not restricted to programming plugins.
Programming, visual scripting, texturing, 3D modelling, modifying assets, etc. are all modding.

<u>In Hytale, anyone can be a modder.</u>
