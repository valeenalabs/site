# Developer Q&A Technical Insights

This extensive Q&A session with Hytale developers reveals critical technical details about the game's architecture, modding philosophy, gameplay systems, and development approach.

## Technical Architecture

### Network & Infrastructure

* **Protocol**: Uses QUIC (reliable UDP with unreliable channels) instead of TCP
* **Server Compatibility**: Runs on any platform supporting Java 25
* **Connection Method**: Direct IP initially, server discovery planned post-launch
* **Data Layer**: Current custom serialization format will be replaced post-launch
* **Performance**: Multi-core support - each world has main thread + parallel execution
* **Rendering**: OpenGL 3.3 for Mac compatibility, potential future Vulkan/Metal migration
* **Tick Model**: Base server tick rate is 30 TPS by default; can be changed using server plugins.

### Security & Distribution

* **No Client-Side Code Execution**: Prevents remote code execution exploits
* **Downloads Limited To**: Configuration files and assets only
* **Mod Distribution**: Community platforms (CurseForge, Modrinth), no immediate in-game marketplace
* **Server Hosting**: Available day 1, no business agreements required (just EULA/TOS)

## Modding Capabilities

### Server-Side Power

* **Full Java Access**: Database connections, web requests, any Java functionality
* **Custom Libraries**: Can create Lua scripting, ML frameworks, or any Java library
* **Server Modification**: Shared source code allows heavy server modifications
* **Hot Reload**: Supported for most asset types
* **Documentation**: Public GitBook planned, though initially sparse

### Content Creation (No Code Required)

* **World Generation**: Custom biomes and maps without Java
* **NPCs & Items**: JSON-based configuration
* **Crafting Recipes**: Data-driven system
* **Visual Scripting**: Replaces command blocks, fully sandboxed
* **Prefab System**: Sophisticated building blocks with in-game editor

### Advanced Modding

* **Combat System**: Data-driven interaction system for attack chains and abilities
* **Sub-Hitboxes**: Support for complex boss mechanics (needs improvement)
* **Status Effects**: Buff/debuff system with custom effects and stats
* **Custom UI**: NoesisGUI transition enables powerful interface customization
* **Block Physics**: Selective system (trees fall, but placed blocks don't)

## Gameplay Systems

### Core Mechanics

* **Stamina System**: No hunger by default (can be modded in)
* **Gravity**: Selective block physics - trees collapse, buildings can float
* **Lighting**: Major overhaul to fix model/voxel inconsistencies
* **World Height**: Currently limited, may change with voxel storage updates
* **Automation**: No redstone equivalent at launch (moddable)

### Player Systems

* **Character Models**: Humans by default, changeable in creative mode
* **Multiplayer Avatars**: Server-controlled (no custom models in multiplayer)
* **Skins**: Full customization possible ("mod yourself into a potato")
* **Shapeshifting**: Transformation potions exist for fun/modding

### World & NPCs

* **Faction System**: Living world with dynamic NPC interactions
* **Village Systems**: Planned dynamic villages with relationships and behaviors
* **Chunk Loading**: Entities unload when out of all players' render distance
* **Seeds**: Shareable world generation seeds supported

## Development Philosophy

### Release Strategy

* **Base Game Priority**: Adventure mode is primary focus, modding architecture supports it
* **Tech Debt**: Acknowledged as necessary for release, commitment to improvement
* **Update Frequency**: Very frequent updates planned, especially post-launch
* **Version Policy**: Always latest version, but servers can run modified versions

### Community Focus

* **Creator Support**: Development bounties planned for community contributors
* **Tutorials**: Official modding tutorials planned with partners
* **Feedback Integration**: Strong commitment to community-driven improvements
* **Accessibility**: Designed for lower-end hardware, reasonable system requirements

### Tools & Documentation

* **Blockbench Integration**: Replaces custom "Hytale Model Maker"
* **Machinima Tools**: Full cinematic creation capabilities
* **Creative Tools**: Major reveal planned for building/creation features
* **Source Access**: Server code will be unobfuscated with developer comments

## Platform Support

* **Current**: Windows (primary)
* **Planned**: Mac/Linux support actively in development
* **VR**: Not feasible in near future
* **Performance**: Uncapped framerate, designed for accessibility
* **Offline Play**: Single-player works without internet connection

## Monetization & Legal

* **No Pay-to-Win**: Firm commitment against P2W mechanics
* **Cosmetics Only**: Low-price cosmetic packs to support infrastructure
* **Server EULA**: Terms being finalized for server monetization policies
* **QUIC Blocking**: Acknowledged issue in some regions, no alternative protocol

## Current Limitations

* **Custom Shaders**: Not supported until sandboxing solution found
* **UI/Input Limitations**: Being expanded but currently restricted
* **Documentation**: Sparse initially, will improve over time
* **Client Mods**: No client-side code execution for security
* **Nameplates**: Currently limited customization

This comprehensive technical foundation positions Hytale as a secure, extensible platform that empowers creators while maintaining performance, accessibility, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
