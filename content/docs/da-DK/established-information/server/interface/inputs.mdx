Hytale is designed to support a variety of input methods to accommodate different player preferences and platforms.

## Interaction System

Hytale features a robust interaction system that allows plugins to customize how keybinds are interpreted and what actions they trigger. This system is data-driven, enabling modders to create complex interactions through assets.

Modders can define custom keybinds for various actions, such as using abilities or interacting with objects in the game world. The interaction system is designed to be powerful, though it may require some effort to manage the complexity of the assets involved.

> You can use your own interactions to use keybinds for whatever you want. Interaction system is very powerful but we still need to work on its usability as the assets can become quite complex and hard to handle
