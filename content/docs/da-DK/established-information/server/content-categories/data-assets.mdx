# Data Assets

Data Assets are JSON files which drive gameplay behavior and core content in Hytale. They provide a powerful, data-driven approach to creating and modifying game elements without needing to write code.

## What Are Data Assets?

Data Assets allow you to create or modify fundamental game elements through JSON configuration files:

* **Blocks**: Define new block types and their properties
* **Items**: Create custom items with unique behaviors
* **NPCs**: Configure non-player characters and their AI
* **World generation**: Control how the world is generated
* **Loot tables**: Define what items drop from various sources

## Comparison to Minecraft

Data Assets are analogous to Minecraft's data pack JSON files, but with significantly broader scope. While Minecraft's data packs are somewhat limited, Hytale's data-driven architecture means that core game elements like blocks, items, and NPCs can all be modified through JSON files.

This expanded data-driven approach gives modders much more power to customize the game without needing to dive into complex programming.

## Development Tools

Recognizing that JSON editing can be tedious and error-prone when done by hand, Hytale plans to provide multiple tools to make working with Data Assets more accessible:

### Node Editor

Hytale is developing a "Node Editor" to make Data Asset management more user-friendly:

* **Visual interface**: Provides a graphical way to work with data relationships
* **Customization focus**: Particularly helpful for customizing NPCs, interactions, and world generation
* **Integrated workflow**: Works directly within the Hytale Asset Editor for a unified creator suite
* **Accessibility**: Makes complex data relationships easier to understand and modify

### Additional Tools

Beyond the Node Editor, Hytale plans to support:

* **Visual JSON generators**: Graphical interfaces for creating JSON without writing syntax
* **Form-based editors**: Structured forms that generate the appropriate JSON automatically
* **Multiple workflow options**: Different tools for different comfort levels and use cases

## Power and Simplicity

The effectiveness of Data Assets is demonstrated by their simplicity. For example, making raptors rideable in Hytale reportedly requires only 4 lines of JSON configuration - showcasing how powerful yet accessible the system is designed to be.

This balance between power and accessibility is central to Hytale's modding philosophy: providing professional-grade tools that don't require programming expertise to use effectively.

## Integration with Other Systems

Data Assets work seamlessly with Hytale's other development approaches:

* **Visual Scripting**: Can reference and manipulate data defined in Data Assets
* **Java plugins**: Can read from and modify Data Assets for more complex behaviors
* **Asset Editor**: Provides a unified interface for managing both visual assets and their data configurations

This integration ensures that Data Assets aren't isolated configuration files, but rather a core part of Hytale's comprehensive development environment.
