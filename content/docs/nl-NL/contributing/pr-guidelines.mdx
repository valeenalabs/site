# Pull Request Guidelines

To ensure a smooth and efficient review process, both contributors and reviewers should adhere to the following guidelines when submitting and reviewing pull requests (PRs).

## For Contributors

1. **Descriptive Titles and Descriptions**
   - Use clear and concise titles that summarize the changes.
   - Provide detailed descriptions of what the PR does, why the changes are necessary, and any relevant context.
2. **Link to Issues**
   - In your PR title, add `GH-ISSUE-NUMBER` to link the PR to the relevant issue. This is required for all PRs.
3. **Small, Focused Changes**
   - Aim to keep PRs small and focused on a single issue or feature. This makes it easier for reviewers to understand and provide feedback.
4. **Code Quality**
   - Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and best practices.
   - Include comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
5. **Testing**
   - Test your changes thoroughly before submitting the PR.
   - If applicable, include unit tests or integration tests to verify your changes.
6. **Documentation**
   - Update or add documentation as needed to reflect your changes.
7. **Commit Messages**
   - Use clear and descriptive commit messages that follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
8. **Check for Conflicts**
   - Before submitting your PR, ensure that your branch is up to date with the base branch to minimize merge conflicts.

## For Reviewers

- You are supposed to review PRs thoroughly, and request changes if needed.
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- Verify that the changes meet the project's coding standards and best practices.
- Deploy the PR using the dokploy integration to ensure the changes work as expected.
- Ensure that documentation is updated as necessary.
- Approve the PR only when you are satisfied with the changes and all checks have passed.
