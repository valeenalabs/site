Variables are containers that store data in your program. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information.

## What is a Variable?

A variable has three key components:

1. **Type**: What kind of data it holds (e.g., integer, string, boolean)
2. **Name**: The label you use to refer to the variable
3. **Value**: The data it contains

## Declaring/Creating Variables

In Java, you must declare a variable before using it, like you'd need a box before putting something in it. The syntax is:

```java
int age;
age = 18;

int age = 18; // Declaration and assignment in one line
```

## Primitive Data Types

You might wonder what "int" means. It's a primitive data type in Java. Java has 8 primitive data types. Here are the most important ones for modding:

| Data Type | Description                   | Example                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| int       | Integer (whole numbers)       | `int score = 100;`         |
| double    | Decimal numbers               | `double pi = 3.14;`        |
| boolean   | True or false values          | `boolean isActive = true;` |
| char      | Single character              | `char grade = 'A';`        |
| String    | Sequence of characters (text) | `String name = "Hytale";`  |

## Type Conversion

Sometimes you might not want a variable to stay the same type. You can convert between types:

### Automatic

```java
int num = 10;
double decimalNum = num; // 10.0 - works automatically
```

### Manual (Casting)

```java
double decimalNum = 9.78;
int num = (int) decimalNum; // 9 - decimals are dropped
```

## Constants

If you want a variable that shouldn't change, use the `final` keyword:

```java
final double PI = 3.14159;
```

**Convention**: Constants use ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

## Practice

It's best to practice what you just learnt - don't look above now and try to do this yourself. If you get stuck, look back up!

1. Declare an integer variable named `lives` and set it to 3.
2. Declare a double variable named `gravity` and set it to 9.81.
3. Declare a boolean variable named `isGameOver` and set it to false.
4. Convert the `lives` variable to a double and store it in a new variable named `livesAsDouble`.
5. Declare a constant named `MAX_LEVEL` and set it to 100.

Great! You've learned about variables and data types in Java. Now we're going to learn about operators and expressions in the next lesson.
