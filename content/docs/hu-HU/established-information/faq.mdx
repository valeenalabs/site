On this page, we'll answer some of your Frequently Asked Questions.

## 1. Can the client be modded?

No, the client is not able to be modded, although the Client will not have control over how the game and the UI looks.

The server decides the visuals, more like the "Resource Packs" available in Minecraft. The server decides what mods are used

## 2. What Network Protocol will be used?

Hytale will use the QUIC transport protocol.

For context, the two main Internet protocols are UDP and TCP.

* UDP is connectionless, fast, fire-and-forget packets but has less reliability as packets can be lost.
* TCP is connection-based, slower than UDP, can guarantee packet delivery with much more reliability.
  Both are pretty fast in modern times, games can run fine on both (but generally prefer UDP).

QUIC is a **hybrid protocol** that builds off UDP to get the same speed benefits, but adds some layers of reliability like TCP.
Essentially, a solid choice for game development that blends speed and reliability.

## 3. What are Transfer Packets?

Transfer packets in Hytale are small data payloads *(4kb)* that allow players to move from one server to another while carrying information.
They are not equivalent to something like BungeeCord or Velocity and are primarily intended for smaller servers.

Unlike BungeeCord, they do not manage network-wide features such as global plugins.
Implementing DDOS protection would also be incredibly hard for smaller networks by using transfer packets.

Transfer packets work quite well in scenarios such as small server networks or hubs where players will hop between servers without the loss of progress. For example, a player might finish a dungeon on one server and then move to a lobby or different game mode with their inventory and stats intact. This lessens server costs and enables the developers to put more effort into gameplay improvement rather than complicated network setups.

## 4. Will Hytale support dedicated servers?

Yes, Hytale will support dedicated servers. This allows server owners to host their own Hytale servers on their own hardware or through third-party hosting services.

Dedicated servers provide more control over server settings, mods, and performance compared to using official hosting solutions.

## 5. Will Hytale support modding on consoles?

As of now, Hytale modding is primarily focused on PC platforms.
