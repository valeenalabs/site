Please complete the [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) guide before this.

Once you have completed the Getting Started guide, you should have a Hytale Prop model ready to go. In this guide, we will cover how to create an actual model using Blockbench.

You probably should change your view based on how you prefer by using the joystick at the bottom right corner of the viewport. It'll look like a joystick. Left click and rotate.

Let's put a cube on the viewport now!

Click on the "**+**" button in the "OUTLINER" section and click on "**Add Cube**" in the dropdown menu.

You should now see something like this:

You will see some values populate the "Transform" field. This is how you can control how big the cube is in all axis's

É assim que você pode adicionar mais cubos e outras formas ao seu modelo.
