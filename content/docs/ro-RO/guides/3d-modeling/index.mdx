## Getting Started with 3D Modeling

Before moving on to the specifics of 3D modeling, it's important to understand the context in which you'll be working. You should follow the guidelines that the Hytale team has established for creating assets for their game, to make your models fit in with the rest of the game world.

> Hytale is a modern, stylized voxel game, with retro pixel-art textures. Hytale art style was born of a combination of influences. By fully leveraging modern game engine capabilities while preserving the charm of our old-school pixel art, we are at the intersection of low-definition pixel art and hand-painted 3D. - Art Director Thomas Frick

The Hytale Team has published a full blog post on how to make models for Hytale, which you can find [here](https://hytale.com/news/2021/12/3d-modeling-in-hytale). This blogpost is very useful for understanding the specific requirements and techniques for creating assets in the game.
