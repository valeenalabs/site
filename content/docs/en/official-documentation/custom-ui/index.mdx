# Custom UI

## What is Custom UI?

Custom UI is Hytale's framework for creating **custom user interfaces** controlled by the game server. Unlike the built-in Client UI (which is part of the game client and cannot be modified), Server UI allows you to create interactive screens and HUD overlays through Java plugins and asset packs.

As a modder, Custom UI gives you the power to:

* **Create custom interactive pages** - Shop interfaces, quest dialogs, server settings menus, admin panels
* **Add custom HUD overlays** - Quest trackers, status displays, custom health bars, server information
* **Design with markup** - Use `.ui` files to define reusable UI templates
* **Handle user interactions** - Respond to button clicks, form submissions, and other events
* **Localize your UI** - Support multiple languages using the game's translation system

## How Custom UI Fits Into Hytale's UI

Hytale's user interface is divided into two main categories:

### Client UI (Not Moddable)

Built-in interfaces controlled by the C# game client:

* Main menu and settings
* Character creation
* Built-in HUD (health, hotbar, chat)
* Inventory and crafting screens
* Development tools

**You cannot modify these** - they are part of the core game client.

### In-Game UI (Moddable via Server)

Server-controlled interfaces that you can create and customize:

#### Custom Pages

Full-screen interactive overlays that appear during gameplay:

* Can be dismissed by the player (ESC key)
* Capture all input (keyboard and mouse)
* Support loading states while waiting for server responses
* Perfect for: shops, dialogs, menus, configuration screens

#### Custom HUDs

Persistent overlay elements drawn on top of the game world:

* Display-only (no user interaction)
* Always visible during gameplay
* Lightweight and non-intrusive
* Perfect for: quest objectives, status indicators, server info panels

## Architecture Overview

Server UI uses a **command-based architecture**:

```
┌─────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────┐
│   Java Server       │         │    C# Client         │
│   (Your Plugin)     │         │    (Game)            │
├─────────────────────┤         ├──────────────────────┤
│                     │         │                      │
│ InteractiveCustomUI │         │   CustomPage or      │
│ Page                │         │   CustomHud          │
│   ↓ build()         ├────────→│     ↓ Apply          │
│ UICommandBuilder    │         │   Element Tree       │
│   - append()        │         │     ↓ Layout         │
│   - set()           │         │   Rendered UI        │
│   - clear()         │         │                      │
│                     │         │                      │
│ ↓ handleDataEvent() │← Events │   User Interaction   │
│   Process input     │         │   (click, type, etc) │
│   sendUpdate()      │         │                      │
└─────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────┘
```

**The flow:**

1. Your Java code builds UI using `UICommandBuilder`
2. Commands are sent to the client as data
3. Client parses `.ui` markup files and creates visual elements
4. User interacts with the UI
5. Events are sent back to your Java code
6. You process events and send updates back

## Key Principles

### Declarative, Not Imperative

You don't create UI objects directly. Instead, you send **commands** that describe what you want:

* "Append this button template to that container"
* "Set this label's text to 'Hello World'"
* "Clear all children from this list"

### Asset-Driven

UI structure is defined in `.ui` markup files (assets), not hardcoded in Java. This enables:

* Designers to modify layouts without touching code
* Reusable UI components
* Consistent visual language

### Event-Driven

User interactions trigger events that flow back to your server code. You register event bindings and handle them in `handleDataEvent()`.

### Selector-Based

You target specific UI elements using **selectors:**

* `#MyButton` - Element with ID "MyButton"
* `#List[0]` - First child of element "List"
* `#List[0] #Title` - Element with ID "Title" in the first child of element "List"
* `#Label.TextColor` - The TextColor property of element "Label"
