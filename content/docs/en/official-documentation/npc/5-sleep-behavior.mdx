Let's add a new top level **Sleep** state. For illustrative purposes, the Idle state has been truncated.

```json
"Sensor": {
    "Type": "State",
    "State": "Idle"
},
"Instructions": [ ... ],
"Sensor": {
    "Type": "State",
    "State": "Sleep"
},
"Instructions": [ ... ]

```

And now we add another action to the **Random** action list to move to the **Sleep** state.

```json
"Sensor": {
    "Type": "State",
    "State": ".Default"
},
"Instructions": [
    {
        "Actions": [
            {
                "Type": "Random",
                "Actions": [
                    {
                        "Weight": 80,
                        "Action": {
                            "Type": "State",
                            "State": ".Guard"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "Weight": 20,
                        "Action": {
                            "Type": "State",
                            "State": "Sleep"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]

```

Notice the weights in this case - there's a 20% chance that the ogre will go to sleep any time it decides to switch behaviour, but an 80% chance that it'll just keep standing guard instead.

We still need to actually add the sleeping behaviour, but first we'll add Instruction with the **Timeout** action to the beginning of the **Sleep** state, just like we did with **.Guard**. We just remove **"Continue": true** because we only have one instruction.
