### SimpleInteraction 

Most interaction types below are inherited from SimpleInteraction and have these
 fields.  If a type does not have these fields, the documentation will mention it.

The purpose of SimpleInteraction is to facilitate Interaction chaining by taking different paths
 based on whether the Interaction succeeded or failed.  The circumstances under which
 a given Interaction fails are generally type-specific (and described in the documentation
 below), but all interactions will be marked failed if they are cancelled via one of the
 many, many mechanisms for doing so.

It is valid to create an interaction asset of type "Simple", which can be valuable when you want to use the 
  interaction fields with no additional functionality.

**SimpleInteraction Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Next | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | After this Interaction has finished, "Next" will be executed if this Interaction did not fail. |
| Failed | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | After this Interaction has finished, "Failed" will be executed if this Interaction failed. |


## Flow Control

These are interaction types used to control the flow of an interaction chain and allow interactions
 to be composed into more complex behaviors.  These interaction types generally do not pertain to 
 the game and instead pertain to the interaction system itself.


### Condition 

This interaction will fail if one of the fields is provided but does not match the current state.

**Condition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| RequiredGameMode | `GameMode` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the current GameMode does not match the provided value. |
| Jumping | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Jumping state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be jumping, if False, the player must not be) |
| Swimming | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Swimming state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be swimming, if False, the player must not be) |
| Crouching | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Crouching state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be crouching, if False, the player must not be) |
| Running | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Running state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be running, if False, the player must not be) |
| Flying | `Boolean` | **No** | If provided, the interaction will fail if the player's Flying state does not match the provided value. (i.e. if True, the player must be flying, if False, the player must not be) |

**GameMode Values**
- `Creative`: The game is currently in Creative Mode 
- `Adventure`: The game is currently in Adventure Mode 


### FirstClick

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields. 

This interaction has two fields that each contain a reference to an Interaction: Click and Hold.  If the root interaction 
 of the chain was initiated by a client button/key press (or simulated NPC input) and the input was a tap, then 
 the Click interaction is run. if it was a longer press, then the Hold interaction is run.

As a minor implementation detail, this interaction is internally marked as failed when the Hold path is followed. 
 This generally shouldn't matter.  If the interaction was not initiated by a key press at all, the Click path will be followed,
 but it seems risky to rely on that behavior.

**FirstClick Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Click | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | If provided and the root interaction of the chain was initiated by button/key press, this interaction is executed next if the press was a quick tap. |
| Hold | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | If provided and the root interaction of the chain was initiated by a button/key press, this interaction is executed next if the press was a longer hold. |


### Interrupt 

This interaction can be used to cancel one or more running interaction chains on an entity and **all forked interaction 
  chains those chains have spawned that are still currently running**.  All interaction chains canceled in this manner will be marked as 
  Failed, which may have additional implications if the canceled chains are themselves forked from 
  other chains that are still running.

**Interrupt Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Entity | `InteractionTarget`<br />(Default: User) | **Yes** | The entity that is the owner of the target interaction chains.  This field can indicate the Owner, User, or Target of this interaction chain. |
| InterruptTypes | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `InteractionType`) | **No** | A set of InteractionTypes that are to be interrupted. Only interactions of these types are affected. If null, all types will be interrupted.<br />**(Note: An empty set will interrupt NO TYPES.)** |
| RequiredTag | `String` | **No** | An asset tag that, if provided, the RootInteraction of the interaction chain must have in order to be canceled. |
| ExcludedTag | `String` | **No** |  An asset tag that, if provided, the RootInteraction of the interaction chain must not have in order to be canceled. |

**InteractionTarget Values**
- `User` - The user of this interaction chain. The entity whose actions caused this interaction chain to be executed. This is usually the same as the Owner.
- `Owner` - The owner of this interaction chain. The entity upon whom this interaction chain is executing.
- `Target` - The entity target of this interaction chain, if any.  This value is mutable (and can therefore come from many places) but most commonly, it is an entity the User was targeting when this interaction chain began executing.

**InteractionType Values**
- `Primary`
- `Secondary`
- `Ability1`
- `Ability2`
- `Ability3`
- `Use`
- `Pick`
- `Pickup`
- `CollisionEnter`
- `CollisionLeave`
- `Collision`
- `EntityStatEffect`
- `SwapTo`
- `SwapFrom`
- `Death`
- `Wielding`
- `ProjectileSpawn`
- `ProjectilHit`
- `ProjectileMiss`
- `ProjectileBounce`
- `Held`
- `HeldOffhand`
- `Equipped`
- `Dodge`
- `GameModeSwap`


### Parallel

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields. 

This interaction has a field `Interactions` that is an array of RootInteraction assets. The list must contain at least 
  two RootInteractions.  This interaction will fork all of its children except for the first into their 
  own interaction chains and immediately complete. After this interaction completes, this interaction chain will 
  execute the first RootInteraction in the `Interactions` list.

This interaction does not have any failure conditions and is indifferent to the fate of the forked interaction chains.

**Parallel Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Interactions | `AssetArray`<br />(Element Type: `RootInteraction`) | **Yes** | An array of RootInteractions that will be forked or executed. |


### Repeat 

This interaction has a field `ForkInteractions` that is an asset of type RootInteraction. This interaction will fork that 
  RootInteraction into its own interaction chain and then wait for it to complete. If the RootInteraction fails, this 
  interaction will complete immediately and be marked failed. Otherwise, the RootInteraction will be forked and run again,
  up to a specified total number of times.

**Repeat Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| ForkInteractions | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **Yes** | A RootInteraction that will be forked. |
| Repeat | `Integer`<br />(Default: 1)<br />**Must be -1 or a positive integer. 0 is not valid.** | **No** | The total number of times to fork ForkInteractions. If -1 is provided, ForkInteractions will continue being forked and executed indefinitely, until this interaction is cancelled or until ForkInteractions fails. |


### Replace 

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields.

This interaction uses the InteractionVars system that is avaiable for items. InteractionVars are RootInteractions that 
  can be attached to an Item asset with a name.
  
This interaction specifies a var name, and if this interaction chain was executed through 
  an item and that item has an InteractionVar of the same name, then this interaction will immediately execute 
  the RootInteraction on the var.  Otherwise, it will execute the default RootInteraction specified in this interaction. 
  If no default is specified, then this interaction will be marked as failed.

**Replace Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Var | `String` | **Yes** | The name of the InteractionVar to execute. |
| DefaultValue | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **No** | The RootInteraction to execute if the owning item does not have an InteractionVar by the specified name. If not provided, the interaction will be marked as failed instead. |
| DefaultOk | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If false, then an angry message will be printed to the server logs if the owning item does not have an InteractionVar by the specified name.  The functioning of this interaction will be otherwise unaffected. |


### RunRootInteraction 

This interaction immediately executes the provided RootInteraction as part of this interaction chain. This interaction 
  does not have any failure conditions.

**RunRootInteraction Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| RootInteraction | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **Yes** | The RootInteraction to execute. |


### Selector 

This interaction will execute a Selector to find entities and/or blocks (depending on the Selector) and fork off an 
  interaction chain for each located entity or block. This interaction will not wait for those interaction chains
  to complete and is indifferent to their fate. The forked interaction chains will use the located entity/block as 
  their target entity/target block. Each entity or block will only fork one interaction chain over the life of this 
  interaction.  The Selector is guaranteed to run once for each execution of this interaction, but some Selectors 
  are intended to be run over a period of time and sweep across an area to locate targets. In order to use those Selectors 
  properly, you will need to extend the execution time of this interaction using `RunTime` or `WaitForAnimationToFinish`.
  The Selector will be executed repeatedly over the lifetime of the interaction.

If the Selector is configured to locate entities, you can add additional sets of entity matching rules. If a located entity 
  matches one of the rules, the matching RootInteraction will be forked instead of the standard `HitEntity` RootInteraction.

Entities located by the Selector will be ignored if they do not have a NetworkId, if they are dead, or if they are invulnerable.
  The only exception to this rule is that players in Creative Mode that are marked to receive hits will not be ignored.

This interaction's failure conditions are configurable via the `FailOn` field. You can configure this interaction to never 
  fail, to fail if the Selector does not locate any blocks before this interaction finishes executing, to fail if the 
  Selector does not locate any entities before this interaction finishes executing, or to fail in either case.

**Selector Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Selector | `Selector` | **Yes** | The Selector is executed at least once and may be executed repeatedly to locate blocks and/or entities in an area. |
| HitEntity | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **No** | If included and the `Selector` locates an entity that does not match any `HitEntityRules`, this RootInteraction will be forked into a new interaction chain with the located entity as the target entity. |
| HitEntityRules | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `HitEntity`) | **No** | If included, these rules will be matched against any entity located by the `Selector`. If an entity matches a set of rules, the RootInteraction associated with the rules will be forked instead of the standard `HitEntity` interaction. |
| HitBlock | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **No** | If included and the `Selector` locates a block, this RootInteraction will be forked into a new interaction chain with the located block as the block target. |
| FailOn | `FailOnType`<br />(Default: `Neither`) | **No** | Defines under what circumstances this interaction will fail.  It can be marked to fail when it completes without locating any blocks, it can be marked to fail when it completes without locating any entities, both, or neither. |
| IgnoreOwner | `Boolean`<br />(Default: true) | **No** | If true, the Selector will not locate the User entity of this interaction. |

**HitEntity Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Matchers | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `EntityMatcher`) | **Yes** | A set of rules that an entity must match. An entity must successful match all rules to be considered. |
| Next | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **Yes** | The RootInteraction to fork if an entity matches all rules. |

**EntityMatcher Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Type | `String` | **Yes** | If provided, specifies a type of EntityMatcher to use. Each matcher type may come with additional fields. |
| Invert | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, an entity must fail this rule for it to be marked as succeeded. |

**EntityMatcher Type: Player**

This EntityMatcher will succesfully match the entity only if they are a player.

**EntityMatcher Type: Vulnerable**

This Entitymatcher will successfully match the entity only if they are not marked as invulnerable.

**FailOnType Values**

- `Neither`
- `Entity`
- `Block`
- `Either`


### Serial 

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields.

This interaction has a field `Interactions` which is a list of Interaction assets. This interaction immediately 
  completes and the interaction chain continues by executing the interactions in the list one at a time. This 
  interaction does not have any failure conditions.

**Serial Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Interactions | `AssetArray`<br />(Element Type: `Interaction`) | **Yes** | An array of Interaction assets to execute. |


## Cooldowns 

RootInteractions interface with a complex cooldown system that can be used for a variety of purposes. Aside from simply 
  adding an important aspect of resource management to your game design, cooldowns can be used to ensure that click-activated 
  interaction chains don't repeatedly spam if the player holds down the input. 

By default, every RootInteraction has a cooldown timer that is keyed to the RootInteraction name, and by default, it 
  will launch a cooldown of 0.35 seconds when activated by client input.  Otherwise, no cooldown will be activated.  However,
  by configuring your RootInteraction, you can change the key for the cooldown (so that multiple RootInteractions can share 
  a single cooldown), set the cooldown timer to whatever you like, and configure multiple charges that can build up over time
  to allow the entity to activate the RootInteraction multiple times before being forced to pause.

One important concept to keep in mind is the difference between **cooldown** and **charge time**.  The cooldown, if any,
  is activated each time a RootInteraction triggers, even if the player has more available charges. If the RootInteraction 
  is configured to use charges, then they will gradually build up over time. In order for a RootInteraction to be activated,
  the cooldown (if any) must be expired, and the RootInteraction must have at least one charge (if it has been 
  configured to use charges). 

Bear in mind that the entire Cooldown configuration is shared between different RootInteractions with the same cooldown id.
  If you activate an ability with 5 charges and a short cooldown and then another ability with a much longer cooldown and no 
  charges, the second ability will use the cooldown properties of the first ability until/unless the first ability finishes 
  charging and is cleared from the system.  You should generally only have multiple RootInteractions share a cooldown id 
  if they have the same configuration.

The interactions below interact with the cooldown system to allow you to manipulate cooldowns via the interaction system. By 
  using these interactions, you can have several interaction chains with different cooldown configurations share cooldowns 
  that are checked and activated as part of the interaction chain itself, or have some components of an interaction change 
  use a second cooldown separate from the main one.

### CooldownCondition

**CooldownCondition Fields**

This interaction will fail if the specified cooldown id is on cooldown for the User entity.  This interaction will only 
  function for players- the interaction will always succeed for NPCs.  In order for this interaction to succeed, the 
  cooldown, if any, must have expired and at least one charge, if any, must have filled.

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `String` | **Yes** | The cooldown id to check. |

### IncrementCooldown

**IncrementCooldown Fields**

This interaction will modify a cooldown that is currently active on the User entity, allowing charges and remaining 
  cooldown to be modified.
  Despite its name, this interaction can be used to reduce a cooldown as well as increase it. If the cooldown is not 
  currently active, this interaction will have no effect. The interaction has no special failure conditions. 

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `String` | **No** | If provided, the cooldown id of the cooldown to be manipulated. If not provided, the cooldown id of the current chain's RootInteraction will be used. |
| Time | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The amount to increase the remaining cooldown by. Can be negative. The remaining cooldown time will not be reduced below zero or increased above the maximum cooldown time. |
| ChargeTime | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The amount to increase the remaining time until the next charge is filled by. Can be negative. The remaining charge time cannot be reduced below zero or increased above the maximum cooldown time. **This will not work on abilities that have a maximum of 1 charge, for some reason.** |
| Charge | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The amount to increase the number of charges by. Can be negative. The number of charges cannot be reduced below 0 or increased above the maximum. |
| InterruptRecharge | `Boolean`(Default: false) | **No** | If true and `Charge` is not 0, will reset the remaining time to the next charge to the maximum value after changing the charge count. |

### ResetCooldown

This interaction will trigger a cooldown on the User entity with a specified configuration. The charges will be refilled 
  but the cooldown will be immediately triggered.  The mechanisms for deciding on the configuration are a little bit complicated.
  You may specify a cooldown configuration via the `Cooldown` field. If you do not include an `Id` field, then the 
  interaction chain's RootInteraction will be used for any field not specified in the configuration. If there is an active 
  cooldown under the specified `Id` (or under the RootInteraction's cooldown id if none is specified) then the fields 
  from that active cooldown will overwrite data in the RootInteraction's cooldown, but not data in your `Cooldown` field.

**ResetCooldown Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Cooldown | `InteractionCooldown` | **No** | A cooldown configuration to use for the new, reset cooldown. |

**InteractionCooldown Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `String` | **No** | The cooldown id to use for this cooldown. If not provided, the RootInteraction's cooldown id will be used, if any. |
| Cooldown | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The duration of the cooldown, in seconds. | 
| Charges | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `Float`) | **No** | If provided, a list of how many charges this cooldown can build, and how long each charge takes to build, in seconds. |
| InterruptRecharge | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, the charge time will be reset when the number of charges changes. |
| ClickBypass | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, RootInteractions keyed to this cooldown can still be activated when it is on cooldown provided that the RootInteraction was triggered by a distinct key or mouse button press on the client. |


### TriggerCooldown 

This interaction is similar to ResetCooldown, except instead of refilling the cooldown's charges, one charge will be deducted
  as normal.

**TriggerCooldown Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Cooldown | `InteractionCooldown` | **No** | A cooldown configuration to use for the new, reset cooldown. |

**InteractionCooldown Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `String` | **No** | The cooldown id to use for this cooldown. If not provided, the RootInteraction's cooldown id will be used, if any. |
| Cooldown | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The duration of the cooldown, in seconds. | 
| Charges | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `Float`) | **No** | If provided, a list of how many charges this cooldown can build, and how long each charge takes to build, in seconds. |
| InterruptRecharge | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, the charge time will be reset when the number of charges changes. |
| ClickBypass | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, RootInteractions keyed to this cooldown can still be activated when it is on cooldown provided that the RootInteraction was triggered by a distinct key or mouse button press on the client. |


## Combo Chains 

Hytale additionally comes with a rich "combo chaining" system, which allows several inputs in a row to result in different 
  attacks and special moves.  Rather than being attached to the RootInteraction like the cooldown system, these are 
  primarily driven by the `Chaining` interaction.


### Chaining 

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Failed field. Its Next field works differently
  from most interaction types.

Chaining is a type of flow control interaction- each time a Chaining interaction with the same `ChainId` is called, a single 
  interaction in the `Next` list is chosen and the others are ignored. The first time the `ChainId` is used, the first 
  interaction in the list is chosen, the next time the second, etc. Once the end of the list is reached, the first 
  interaction will be chosen again.

Bear in mind: the progress through the Next list is based on the **ChainId**, not the interaction!  That means that two 
  different Chaining interactions can share a single combo chain. You could have a pair of daggers that attacks with 
  the left when the left mouse button is clicked and with the right when the right mouse button is clicked.  You could give 
  both interaction chains a Chaining interaction with the same `ChainId` and three `Next` entries that do a light-light-heavy 
  combo.  Each specific hit would occur with either the left or the right knife based on which button you clicked, but 
  the combo would be otherwise identical regardless of which you chose. 

The Chaining interaction also has a concept called "flags".  It is possible to attach named flags to a `ChainId` by using 
  the ChainFlag interaction.  Then, you specify the flag name in Chaining's `Flags` field. If a Flag is active when the 
  Chaining interaction is run, the Flag's interaction will be run instead of the appropriate interaction in `Next`.
  Bear in mind: the entity's progress through the `Next` list still advances, the resulting `Next` interaction is just not 
  run.  Only one flag can be active at a time.

Lastly, it is possible to cancel the entity's progress through the combo chain and reset them to the first interaction in 
  the list. This can be done with the CancelChain interaction, but it will also happen automatically if the player does 
  not trigger an interaction with the ChainId for the specified ChainingAllowance.  When either of these happen, all flags will be 
  canceled as well.

All of these effects are triggered on the User entity only. Non-players can use the chaining system, but Flags do not currently
  work for non-players.  This interaction has no special failure conditions.

**Chaining Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| ChainId | `String` | **No** | If provided, acts as a key that multiple Chaining interactions can use to share combo chain progress and flags. If not provided, a unique ChainId will be generated for this interaction. | 
| ChainingAllowance | `Double`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | If, at the time this interaction is triggered, it has been this long in seconds since the last time a Chaining interaction with the same ChainId was executed, all state for this ChainId will be cleared before execution. |
| Next | `AssetArray`<br />(Element Type: `Interaction`) | **Yes** | A list of interactions to cycle between each time this interaction is run. |
| Flags | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `String`, Value Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | A map of flag names to interactions to run if the flag is active when this interaction executes. |


### CancelChain 

This interaction resets all progress and flag data on the User entity for the provided `ChainId`.  The next time a Chaining 
  interaction is called for the provided `ChainId`, it will begin at the first interaction in the `Next` list. This
  interaction has no special failure conditions.

| ChainId | `String` | **Yes** | A ChainId whose data should be reset. |


### ChainFlag 

This interaction activates a flag on the User entity for the provided `ChainId`, which can be used to change behavior the 
  next time a Chaining interaction with this `ChainId` is run. This will overwrite any flag that has 
  already been raised. This interaction will have no effect for non-players. This interaction has no special failure 
  conditions.

| ChainId | `String` | **Yes** | A ChainId on whom the flag should be raised. |
| Flag | `String` | **Yes** | The name of the flag to raise. |


## Charging 

A unique flow-control interaction that is frequently used is the Charging interaction.  It is a flow-control interaction 
  that delays while the input button used to trigger the interaction chain is held.  When it is released (or the interaction 
  is forced to end), the interaction chain can continue with a different interaction based on how long the input was held 
  for.

These interactions are all related by either being the Charging interaction, or other interaction types that inherit the
  Charging interaction's behavior.

### Charging 

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore its Next field works different from most interactions.
  This interaction adds its own Failed field which works the same way that SimpleInteraction's does.

This interaction only works properly when its interaction chain was triggered by a client key or button press (or 
  NPC-simulated equivalent). This interaction will continue executing for as long as the key or button press is held (with 
  some exceptions, covered below) by the User entity.  Like other interactions, it has a `Next` field indicating which interaction to execute
  after this one, but the field is a map from `Float` values to `Interaction` assets. When this interaction ends, either 
  due to the input being released or the charge duration completing, this interaction will determine the largest `Float` key that is less 
  than the amount of time in seconds that the interaction was executing for.  The Interaction mapped to that key will be 
  executed next.

The interaction includes some cancellation conditions that are specific to this interaction. For instance, the interaction 
  has a `CancelOnOtherClick` field that matches the field on RootInteraction. If it is active on this interaction but not 
  the RootInteraction, then clicking while charging will cancel this interaction (and execute the `Failed` interaction rather 
  than any of the `Next` interactions) but otherwise continue the interaction chain.

Another valuable feature Charging has is the `Forks` field.  For input-triggered interactions that are triggered while the 
  Charging interaction is executing, you can add an entry for the relevant InteractionType to this field and instead of 
  triggering the usual interaction chain based on held item, targeted block, etc. the RootInteraction specified in the 
  `Forks` field will be triggered.  This can unlock rich attack modes and behaviors. For instance, having a shield bash attack 
  triggered off left click while blocking, or a special attack that triggers when both mouse buttons are pressed at the 
  same time.

There are two modes of operation for the Charging interaction. One is to have the ability charge for as long 
  as the input is held and only end execution when the entity releases the input.  Bows in the main Hytale game work 
  that way.  That is accomplished by setting `AllowIndefiniteHold` to true.  Another mode of operation is to have the 
  interaction complete execution when the execution time has surpassed the largest key value in the `Next` field and 
  immediately begin executing the Interaction mapped to that key.  Food in the main Hytale game work like this.  It 
  is accomplished by setting `AllowIndefiniteHold` to false.

One pitfall to be careful of when setting `AllowIndefiniteHold` to false is the way it interacts with cooldowns.  
  Normally, input-initiated interaction chains start a 0.35s cooldown on the triggered RootInteraction that prevents 
  holding the mouse button from immediately spamming a new interaction when the first one completes.  However, if the 
  duration of a Charging interaction is longer than 0.35s, then the cooldown will have already completed when the 
  interaction chain finishes, which will often result in a new execution beginning immediately before the player can 
  stop pressing the mouse button.  One solution for this problem is to add a `Simple` interaction to the end of your 
  interaction chain with a `RunTime` of 0.35s to simulate the cooldown.  Alternatively, you can add a longer cooldown 
  (the maximum duration of your Charging interaction plus 0.35s) to the RootInteraction. However, the longer cooldown is 
  not always desirable, as the interaction may have ended prematurely, resulting in an unusually long lockout between 
  executions.

**Charging Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| FailOnDamage | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, this interaction will fail and end immediately if the User entity takes any damage while it is executing. |
| CancelOnOtherClick | `Boolean`<br />(Default: true) | **No** | If true, this interaction will fail and end immediately if the User entity sends another button or key press while it is executing. |
| Forks | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `InteractionType`, Value Type: `RootInteraction`) | **No** | A map of InteractionType to RootInteraction. If entity input triggers the InteractionType while this interaction is executing, the mapped RootInteraction will be forked into its own interaction chain. This will happen instead of the usual handling for that InteractionType.  This fork will occur even if `CancelOnOtherClick` is set to true. |
| Failed | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | After this Interaction has finished, "Failed" will be executed if this Interaction failed. |
| AllowIndefiniteHold | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, this interaction will continue executing for as long as the User entity continues to hold the input. If false, execution will end as soon as the execution time in seconds reaches the largest key value in the `Next` map. |
| DisplayProgress | `Boolean`<br />(Default: true) | **No** | If true, players executing this interaction will see a progress bar will be displayed below their cursor indicating how close to reaching the highest key value in `Next` they are. |
| Next | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `Float`, Value Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | A map from `Float` to `Interaction`.  When this interaction successfully finishes executing (either because the input was released or because the maximum duration was reached), this interaction will find the `Float` value with the largest duration in seconds that is less than the amount of time this interaction executed for. That key's mapped Interaction will then be executed. |
| MouseSensitivityAdjustmentTarget | `Float`<br />(Default: 1.0) | **No** | While charging, this mouse sensitivity multiplier will gradually be applied. |
| MouseSensitivityAdjustmentDuration | `Float`<br />(Default: 1.0) | **No** | Duration in seconds. After this many seconds, `MouseSensitivityAdjustmentTarget` will be fully applied to the mouse sensitivity. |
| Delay | `ChargingDelay` | **No** | Settings that allow charging progress to be pushed back when the User entity takes damage. |

**ChargingDelay Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| MinHealth | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | Damage taken as a percentage of entity health (0.0-1.0). If a hit deals less than this much damage, no pushback will be applied.  If a hit deals exactly this much damage, `MinDelay` seconds worth of pushback will be applied. |
| MaxHealth | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | Damage taken as a percentage of entity health (0.0-1.0). If a hit deals at least this much damage, `MaxDelay` seconds worth of pushback will be applied. |
| MinDelay | `Float`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The amount of pushback, in seconds, to apply if the entity takes a hit that deals `MinHealth` damage. The amount of pushback applied by a hit is a gradiant between `MinDelay` and `MaxDelay` based on the amount of damage between `MinHealth` and `MaxHealth`. |
| MaxDelay | `Float`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The amount of pushback, in seconds, to apply if the entity takes a hit that deals at least `MaxHealth` damage. The amount of pushback applied by a hit is a gradiant between `MinDelay` and `MaxDelay` based on the amount of damage between `MinHealth` and `MaxHealth`. |
| MaxTotalDelay | `Float`<br />(Deault: 0) | **No** | The maximum amount of pushback the entity can receive over the course of a single charge, regardless of how many times they are hit. |

### Wielding 

This interaction is inherited from Charging rather than SimpleInteraction.  However, its `Failed` and `Next` fields function 
  identically to SimpleInteraction.  It does not inherit all fields from Charging, so be sure to pay close attention to 
  the field list below.

This interaction drives most blocking behavior in the game. While this interaction is executing, attacks made against 
  the Owner entity will (conditionally) trigger effects defined in this interaction.  Unlike the Charging interaction, 
  this interaction can always execute indefinitely and will only end when it fails or when the input is released.

One option available in Wielding is `AngledWielding`, which allows damage and knockback modifiers to only be applied 
  depending on the direction the attack against the Owner entity is coming from.  The AngledWielding type has a 
  field `Angle` which determines which direction the protection points relative to the player (0 is the player's 
  front), and `AngleDistance` which determines how wide the cone of protection extends around the player.  Block effects 
  from this interaction (such as `BlockedEffects`, `BlockedInteractions`, and `StaminaCost`) will only apply if 
  the DamageCause matches `DamageModifiers` OR if the DamageCause matches `AngledWielding.DamageModifiers` and 
  the source of the damage matches `Angle` and `AngleDistance`.  It is possible for damage and knockback multipliers 
  specified on both this interaction's modifier fields and `AngledWielding`'s modifier fields to stack, if both 
  have entries for the same DamageCause.

This interaction will only have an effect on damage taken by one of the DamageCause entries in `DamageModifiers` or 
  `AngledWielding.DamageModifiers`.  If a DamageCause is in `DamageModifiers`, then the block effect will be triggered 
  and the damage modifier applied regardless of what direction the Owner entity is attacked from.  If a DamageCause is in 
  `AngledWielding.DamageModifiers`, then the damage modifier is only applied if the

## Blocks

These are interaction types meant to reason about and modify blocks in the world.  The most important concept unique
 to these interactions is the Block Target.  Like the Entity Target, it is mutable and can come from many places. 
 However, for interaction chains initiated by the client, the block target will initially be the block that the player's cursor was 
 over, if any.

Additionally, for interaction chains initiated by the client, the client will send along which face of the block is targeted,
 which is used by a few block-related interactions.
 It is left up to each interaction type that cares about block faces as to how to handle this behavior for simulated input 
 (i.e. NPCs initiating chains that are normally initated by the client).  At the time of this writing, all block-related 
 interactions choose the top face where relevant in simulated input.

### BlockCondition 

This interaction has a field `Matchers` which specifies certain conditions, such as block type, state, etc.  This 
 interaction fails if the current target block does not match all of them.

**BlockCondition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Matchers | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `BlockMatcher`) | **Yes** | A list of conditions that the target block must match or this condition will fail.<br />**Note: This field is technically not required but there is a bug that makes it dangerous to not provide at the time of this writing.**<br />**Note: If no conditions are added to this array, the interaction will fail, counterintuitively.** |

**BlockMatcher Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Block | `BlockIdMatcher` | **No** | If provided, requires the block itself match some set of conditions. |
| Face | `BlockFace` | **No** | If provided and not 'None', requires a specific block face be targeted. |
| StaticFace | `Boolean` (Default: false) | **No** | If false, the face condition will be adjusted by the block's current rotation. |

**BlockFace Values**
- `Up`
- `Down`
- `North`
- `South`
- `East`
- `West`
- `None`

**BlockIdMatcher Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------| 
| Id | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `BlockType`) | **No** | If provided, the block must match the specified `BlockType`. |
| State | `String` | **No** | If provided, the block's current state must match the provided state name. |
| Tag | `String` | **No** | If provided, the block type's asset tags must contain the provided tag. |


### DestroyCondition 

This interaction fails if the current User entity cannot destroy the current target blcok.

**DestroyCondition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |


### PlacementCountCondition

This interaction accepts the name of a BlockType that has the TrackedPlacement BlockEntity. The interaction will fail if the number of 
 blocks of the provided BlockType in the world do not match the provided condition.

**PlacementCountCondition Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Block | `String` | **Yes** | The BlockType to examine. The number of instances of the BlockType in the world will be compared to Value.<br />**Note: The specified BlockType must have the TrackedPlacement BlockEntity. Otherwise, the number of blocks in the world will always be zero.** |
| Value | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The value to compare the number of blocks in the world with. |
| LessThan | `Boolean<br />(Default: true) | **No** | If true, the interaction will fail if the number of blocks in the world is greater than or equal to Value. If false, the interaction will fail if the number of blocks in the world is less than or equal to Value. |


### BreakBlock

This interaction attempts to break the target block while acting as the User entity. The User entity must be a player. It 
 is not guaranteed to work, depending on world settings and the User entity's current state, it may not work.  If it 
  fails, it will fail the interaction under some circumstances, but not others. 

**Note: In particular, if `Harvest`=false and the player is in Survival mode, the player will simply execute a damage operation 
 against the block. Even when the Tool field is specified, the player's currently-held item can impact the results in unintuitive 
 ways.**

This interaction will fail if there is no block target, if `Harvest`=true and the 
  block is not harvestable, or if the world settings prevent the Harvest/Break operation.
  It will generally not fail otherwise, even if the block was not broken or damaged.
  The block will generally break every time if `Harvest`=true or the player is in 
  Creative mode.


**BreakBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Harvest | `Boolean` (Default: false) | **No** | If true, harvest the block and deposit the drops in the player's inventory. This operation will generally always succeed.  If false, this interaction will effectively perform whatever action would have occurred if the player had left-clicked the block. |
| Tool | `String` | **No** | If `Harvest`=true, the player is in Survival mode, and this field is provided, then the break operation will be performed as though with this tool type.<br />**This field mostly doesn't work.  Your held item will be used for most block damage calculations regardless of this field's contents.** |
| MatchTool | `Boolean` (Default: false) | **No** | If true, `Harvest`=true, the player is in Survival mode, and `Tool` is provided, block breaking will be prevented unless `Tool` is a valid gathering tool for the target block. The interaction will not be failed, even if block breaking is prevented in this manner. |


### ChangeBlock 

This interaction requires a mapping from one or more current BlockTypes to one or more target BlockTypes.  If the 
  target block is one of the key BlockTypes, then it will be changed to the mapped target BlockType.  If the current 
  BlockType of the target block does not appear as a key in the Changes field, then this interaction fails.

**ChangeBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Changes | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `BlockType`, Value Type: `BlockType`) | **No** | A list of potential block type changes, with each entry having a current and new BlockType id. |
| WorldSoundEventId | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `SoundEvent`) | **No** | If provided, this SoundEvent is played in the world at the position of the block if the block successfully changes. |
| RequireNotBroken | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, this interaction will fail if the player's held item is broken (durability 0), and the block change will not take place. |


### ChangeState 

This interaction requires a mapping from one or more current block state names to one or more state names. If the 
  target block is in one of the key block states, then it will be changed to the mapped target blocks tate. If the 
  current block state of the target block does nto appear as a key in the Changes field, then this interaction fails.

All blocks start out with a null state by default.  This null state can be referenced by the key "default" and the block 
  can be returned to that state with the value "default".

**ChangeState Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| Changes | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `String`, Value Type: `String`) | **No** | A list of potential block state changes, with each entry having a current and new state name. |
| UpdateBlockState | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, performs a full refresh of the block's BlockEntity component and notifies nearby players as though a full block type change occurred. |


### CycleBlockGroup

This interaction will attempt to change the target block to the next block type in one of the BlockGroups it belongs to.
  If the block type belongs to multiple BlockGroups, which one is used is effectively arbitrary. The User entity must be 
  a player. If the block cannot be changed for any reason (entity not a player, no block target, block does not belong 
  to a BlockGroup, etc.). If the block is the only entry in the BlockGroup, this interaction will succeed and the block 
  will be considered changed despite nothing happening.  Unlike most other block-changing interactions, this one will 
  fail if the world settings prevent players from breaking blocks.

**This interaction always reduces the player's held item's durability by a single 'hit' worth of damage if the block
  changes. There is no way to prevent it. The block type will change and the interaction will succeed even if the player's
  held item is broken, however.**

**CycleBlockGroup Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |


### DestroyBlock

This interaction destroys the target block without dropping anything.  It will successfully destroy the block if the 
  target block exists and this interaction has no failure conditions. 
  
**This interaction has no additional fields.**


### PickBlock

This interaction is effectively equivalent to using the middle mouse button in creative mode. In survival mode, the
  block's item will be moved to the user's current active hotbar slot if it is in the player's inventory.  This 
  interaction is performed entirely on the client and cannot be performed by non-players.  It is unclear if this 
  interaction has failure conditions.

**PickBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |


### PlaceBlock

This interaction is effectively identical to a right clicking while holding a block in their hand, with some 
  additional options. For one, it can be executed with any LivingEntity as the User entity. For another, it has some 
  useful fields.  For the most part, though, it follows the same behaviors and rules as any ordinary block placement 
  by a player.

It's not clear under what circumstances this interaction can fail. The server will not fail the interaction under any 
  special circumstances (including when there is no target block, or when `BlockTypeToPlace` is not provided and the 
  LivingEntity is not holding a block). However, the client is very involved with the function of this interaction and 
  its behavior is unknown.

**PlaceBlock Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| BlockTypeToPlace | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `BlockType`) | **No** | If provided, the block placed by this interaction will be the specified BlockType. If not provided, the User entity's held item will be used, instead, if it is a block. |
| RemoveItemInHand | `Boolean`<br />(Default: True) | **No** | If true and the User entity is not a player in Creative mode, the item in the player's hand must match the block being placed and one quantity will be removed for each block placed. If the item does not match, the block cannot be placed.  If false, the player's hand item is ignored entirely.** |
| AllowDragPlacement | `Boolean`<br />(Default: True) | **No** | If true and the interaction was triggered on the client by a player, then the player can hold the input that was used to activate this interaction chain and move the mouse around in order to execute this interaction repeatedly and place several blocks. The interaction chain will not move onto the next interaction until the player releases the input. |


### RunOnBlockTypes

This interaction retrieves all blocks within a provided radius of the User entity. For each block that matches any of 
  the provided BlockSets, a new interaction chain will be forked that uses the matching block as the target block.
  This interaction will continue executing until all forked interaction chains have completed.  The interaction will fail if no 
  blocks within the radius match the provided BlockSets or if all of the forked interaction chains fail.

**RunOnBlockTypes Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Range | `Integer` | **Yes** | The spherical radius around the User entity to search for blocks. Must be at least 1. |
| BlockSets | `AssetArray`<br />(Element Type: `BlockSet`) | **No** | A list of BlockSets to match nearby blocks again. Only blocks that match any of the BlockSets will have interaction chains forked for them. |
| MaxCount | `Integer` | **Yes** | The maximum number of blocks that will be located with the search. Further blocks will be ignored. If there are more matching blocks within the radius than this number, the specific set of blocks that will be found is completely arbitrary and may change from execution to execution. |
| Interactions | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `RootInteraction`) | **No, but yes.** | The RootInteraction that will be forked for each matching block.  This interaction will not fail to validate if it is missing, but every execution of this interaction will fail. |


### UseBlock

If the target block has an interaction for this interaction chain's interaction type, execute it immediately as part of 
  this interaction chain. The execution will be wrapped in UseBlockEvent.Pre and UseBlockEvent.Post events, and cancellations 
  of the UserBlockEvent.Pre event are respected. The User entity is considered the triggering entity for both events.

If the target block does not have an interaction for this interaction chain's interaction type, this interaction fails.

**This interaction has no additional fields.**


## Items 

These are interactions intended to interface with an entity's inventory. There is no concept of an "item target", 
  unfortunately, so these generally either interact with the entity's held item or the entity's inventory at a high level.

### AddItem 

Adds a specified quantity of a specified item to the User entity's inventory, preferring to add it to the 
 entity's hotbar where possible. This interaction will have no effect on User entities that are not LivingEntities.
 This interaction has no failure states.

**Note: This interaction has a bug in its field validators that will cause interactions that reference items declared 
  in the same mod to fail validation on startup.  Additionally, this interaction has a bug that will cause it to
  fail and have no effect if the User entity has no block target. Use ModifyInventory instead.**

**AddItem Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| ItemId | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Item`) | **Yes** | The item id of the item to add to the player's inventory. |
| Quantity | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The quantity of the item to add to the player's inventory. |


### CheckUniqueItemUsage

This interaction will check whether it has run once for the User entity with their currently-held item before. If it hasn't,
  it will succeed. If it has, it will fail. It will also fail if the User entity is not a player. The interaction will record
  the item id of the User entity's currently-held item on success, ensuring it cannot be successfully run with that player 
  and item id combination again.

**This interaction has no additional fields.**


### ChangeActiveSlot

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction and therefore has no Next or Failed fields.  The `CancelOnItemChange`
  field is ignored for this interaction and is always treated as false. This interaction will set the User entity's currently-
  active hotbar slot to the specified slot index. If none is specified, the interaction chain's target slot will be used,
  if any. Otherwise, slot 0 will be used.  If a slot is specified and it is already active, then this interaction will
  have no effect, but if no slot is specified and the interaction chain's target slot is already active, the logic in 
  the next paragraph will still be executed. This interaction will also have no effect if the User entity is not a 
  LivingEntity.  
  
Once the slot has changed, a new SwapTo interaction chain will be forked off for the selected slot.
  If a target slot was specified, then the interaction chain's current target slot will be set to the specified slot, as will 
  the forked SwapTo interaction chain. If this interaction chain was initiated by a player swapping an item into or out of
  an occupied active hotbar slot, then the swap will be executed after the slot is changed and before the SwapTo 
  interaction is forked. Not running this interaction in the resulting SwapFrom interaction chain is a way for the server 
  to cancel players performing these sorts of swap interactions. The default behavior for these swap interactions is that 
  the SwapFrom interaction chain will be initiated with the currently-active-slot as the target slot. As a result, the 
  target slot will usually not change when this interaction runs, it merely exists as a signal for the server to continue the
  item swap.

**ChangeActiveSlot Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| TargetSlot | `Integer` | **No** | If not provided, indicates the slot the player's active hotbar slot should be changed to.  Otherwise, the interaction chain's target slot will be used (which is usually the already-active hotbar slot). |


### EquipItem

This interaction will equip the User entity's currently-held item into the appropriate armor slot, if it is armor. The 
  interaction will fail if the item is armor but it cannot be equipped for some reason. The interaction will succeed but 
  take no action if the User entity cannot equip armor or if the item is not armor.

**This interaction has no additional fields.**


### IncreaseBackpackCapacity

This interaction will increase the User entity's backpack size by the provided amount.  **It will additionally remove one 
  quantity from the player's currently-held item. There is no way to prevent this.**  This interaction will have no effect
  if the User entity is not a player.  This interaction has no special failure conditions, even if the User entity 
  is not a player, or the player is not currently holding an item.

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Capacity | `Integer`<br />(Default: 1) | **No** | The additional backpack capacity to add to the player. **Must be between 1 and 32767.**


### ModifyInventory

This interaction attempts to perform one or more inventory-modifying actions against the User entity. The User entity must 
  be a player. If they are not, no actions will be performed, but the interaction will not fail. Any item removals performed 
  by this interaction, either as a result of `ItemToRemove` or `AdjustHeldItemQuantity`, are both atomic (meaning the entire
  quantity must be removed, or none) and required (meaning that the interaction will fail and no further actions taken if
  the removal fails for any reason).  Item additions performed by this interaction, either as a result of `ItemToAdd` or
  `AdjustHeldItemQuantity` will drop excess items on the ground near the player if necesary and continue on. 

This interaction first executes the item removal in `ItemToRemove`, if any, then adjusts the held item as specified by 
  `AdjustHeldItemQuantity`, if provided, then executes the item addition in `ItemToAdd`, if any, and then finally executes 
  the damage/healing of the held item in `AdjustHeldItemDurability`, if provided.
  
**ModifyDurability Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| RequiredGameMode | `GameMode` | **No** | If provided, only execute the inventory-modifying actions if the player is in the provided GameMode. The interaction will not fail if the GameMode doesn't match. |
| ItemToRemove | `ItemStack` | **No** | If provided, a matching item will be removed in the provided quantity. If there is no matching item in the player inventory in the required quantity, then the interaction will fail and further actions will not be executed. |
| AdjustHeldItemQuantity | `Integer`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The player's held item, if any, will have its quantity will be modified by the provided amount- subtracted from if this number is negative or added to if this item is positive.  If the player has no held item, then this field will have no effect regardless of its value and the interaction will NOT fail.  If the player's inventory does not have sufficient quantity of items to support the removal, this interaction will fail and further actions will not be executed. Excess items will be dropped on the ground near the player. |
| ItemToAdd | `ItemStack` | **No** | If provided, the ItemStack will be added to the player's inventory. Excess items will be dropped on the ground near the player. |
| AdjustHeldItemDurability | `Double`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The player's held item, if any, will have its durability adjusted by the specified amount.  The durability cannot go below 0 or raise above the item's maximum durability. Invalid durability values in this field will not cause the interaction to fail. Neither will it fail if the player has no held item. |
| BrokenItem | `String` | **No** | This field should contain an ItemId, but it is not validated by the server on startup, so be careful.  This field can have the value of "Empty" to specify no item, or an empty hand. If specified and the `AdjustHeldItemDurability` operation reduces the player's held item to 0 durability, the player's held item is changed to this ItemId. If the inventory replacement fails, this interaction will fail. |
| NotifyOnBreak | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true and the `AdjustHeldItemDurability` operation reduces the player's held item to 0 durability, this interaction will perform the usual audiovisual feedback of a broken tool. It will play the usual tool breaking sound and send the player a text message in chat that their item has broken. |
| NotifyOnBreakMessage | `String` | **No** | If provided, and `NotifyOnBreak` is true, when the player is notified of a broken tool by this interaction, the message sent to their chat will instead be the translation key specified by this field. The translation key supports the templating parameter `{itemName}`. See the translation key `server.general.repair.itemBroken_Hoe` for an example. |

**GameMode Values**
- `Creative`: The game is currently in Creative Mode 
- `Adventure`: The game is currently in Adventure Mode 

**ItemStack Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Id | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Item`) | **Yes** | The id of the Item asset this stack contains. |
| Quantity | `Integer`<br />(Default: 1) | **No** | The number of items in this stack.<br />**Must be greater than 0.** |
| Durability | `Double`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The durability of the item stack.<br />**Cannot be negative.** |
| MaxDurability | `Double`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The maximum durability of the item this stack contains.<br />**Cannot be negative.** |
| Metadata | `Bson Document` | **No** | If provided, applies the bson to the item stack metadata. |
| OverrideDroppedItemAnimation | `Boolean`*(Default: false) | **No** | ??? |


### PickupItem

This interaction will attempt to pick up the User entity's current target entity and add it to their inventory. It will 
  fail if the User entity is not a player, if they do not have a target entity, or if the target entity is not an item 
  located in the world.  It will not fail if the player simply cannot pick up the item.  
  
**This interaction has no additional fields.**


### RefillContainer

This interaction will fail if the User entity is not a player. The interaction will draw a ray from the player's head 
  down their look direction until the edge of the player's held item's interaction range or until the first solid block.
  The nearest fluid block of a type listed in this interaction's `States` map will result in the one of the player's 
  currently-held items being converted to the fluid's related item state.  If the `States` map indicates a durability 
  for the new item state, then the converted item will use that durability. If the item is already in the fluid's related 
  item state, then this interaction will fail if the player's held item is already at maximum durability (unless the 
  `States` map indicates a durability value greater than the item's maximum, in which case the interaction will succeed 
  but the item will not change).  Otherwise, the durability listed for the fluid in the `States` map will be added to the 
  item's current durability.

If the interaction has not failed by this point, the fluid block in the world may be transformed to a different type if one is listed 
  in the `States` map. 

If any part of this process does not proceed for any reason (for instance, if the player is not holding an item), 
  then this interaction will fail.

**RefillContainer Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| States | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `String`, Value Type: `RefillState`) | **Yes** | A map from item state names to `RefillState` objects, which contain information such as acceptable fluid block types, durability increases, and what fluid type to convert the targeted fluid block to after refill, if any. If the player targets a fluid block that matches one of the fluid types in the `RefillState`, the item will be converted to the keyed item state and the `RefillState` will be used to decide what happens next. |

**RefillState Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| AllowedFluids | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `String`) | **Yes** | If any of these fluids are targeted by the player, the player's held item will be converted to the keyed item state and `Durability` and `TransformFluid` will be used. |
| Durability | `Double`<br />(Default: -1.0) | **No** | If the player's held item changes item states, this value is the new item's durability, unless it is negative, in which case the item will begin at full durability. If the player's held item is already in the item state, and the item is not already at full durability, this value will be added to the item's durability. |
| TransformFluid | `String` | **No** | If provided, this field is a fluid id that the targeted fluid block should be transformed to if the player's held item is successfully updated. |


## Entities

### DamageEntity

This interaction does not inherit from SimpleInteraction, but adds its own Next and Failed fields that 
  work similarly.

This interaction will cause the User entity to damage the Target entity.  It has the capability to apply different 
  damage based on the direction of the attack or what body part was targeted by the User entity, with each possibility 
  providing different damage calculations, effects, and Next interaction. If multiple entires match the attack, `TargetedDamage`
  (body part damage) takes highest priority, then the first matching `AngledDamage` in the list, then the default 
  damage in the base interaction fields.  It is possible for elements of these different damage priorities to be taken peacemeal if higher-priority 
  damage fields do not overwrite lower-priority damage fields. For instance, 
  damage calculation could be taken from `TargetedDamage`, the damage effects could be taken from the first matching 
  `AngledDamage`, and the Next interaction coming from the default damage field.

If all damage dealt by this interaction is cancelled, then this interaction will fail, and the `Failed` interaction 
  will be executed next in the chain. If any damage dealt by this interaction is blocked, then this interaction will 
  succeed, but the `Blocked` interaction wil lbe executed next in the chain. Otherwise, the highest-precedent matching 
  `Next` interaction that you provide will be executed.  For instance, if you provide `Next` interactions for all 
  `TargetedDamage` and `AngledDamage` entries, and one in the interaction's `Next` field, then a headshot could result 
  in a unique `Next` interaction being executed, even if there is a matching `AngledDamage` entry. However, if you leave 
  the `Next` interaction out of your `TargetedDamage` entries, a special `Next` interaction for backstabs could be 
  executed.  Otherwise, the `Next` field in the root of the interaction will be executed instead.

DamageEntity has an unusual relationship with `RunTime`. This interaction always ends immediately after its first tick,
  regardless of the status of `RunTime` or `WaitForAnimationToFinish`.  However, if damage dealt by this interaction is 
  calculated as `DamageCalculatorType` `Dps`, then the `RunTime` will be used to determine the precise amount of damage to 
  deal. If `RunTime` is 0, then no damage will be dealt.

**DamageEntity Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| DamageCalculator | `DamageCalculator` | **No** | If provided, describes the damage amounts and types to apply to the Target entity. |
| DamageEffects | `DamageEffects` | **No** | If provided, describes particles, sounds, knockback, etc. to apply to the target entity on damage. |
| Next | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No**  After this interaction has finished, "Next" will be executed if damage was dealt to the target and none was blocked. |
| AngledDamage | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `AngledDamage`) | **No** | If provided, allows alternative `DamageCalculator`, `DamageEffects`, and `Next` entries for attacks that approach the target from certain angles. |
| TargetedDamage | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `String`, Value Type: `TargetedDamage`) | **Yes** | This field must be provided, but is not required to have any entries.  This is a map from body part names to `TargetedDamage` values. Hypixel only uses one body part name: `Head`, and it is not clear whether there are others.  If provided, allows alternative `DamageCalculator`, `DamageEffects`, and `Next` entries for attacks that damage specific enemy body parts. |
| EntityStatsOnHit | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `EntityStatOnHit`) | **No** | If provided, allows this attack to reduce enemy stats other than health.  Each individual damage application dealt by the same ability will apply stat reductions, at diminishing returns. All damage dealt in interaction chains forked by a Selector interaction will share the number of hits across all targets. |
| Failed | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | After this interaction has finished, "Failed" will be executed if no damage hits were applied to the player, or if all damage hits were cancelled. |
| Blocked | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | After this interaction has finished, "Blocked" will be executed if any damage hits were blocked by the target. |

**DamageCalculator Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Type | `DamageCalculatorType`<br />(Default: Absolute) | **No** | Whether the damage being applied is `Absolute` or `Dps'. |
| Class | `DamageClass`<br />(Default: Unknown) | **No** | The type of attack producing the damage. Some weapon systems apply equipment modifiers based on this value. |
| BaseDamage | `Map`<br />(Key Type: `DamageCause`, Value Type: `Float`) | **No** | A set of DamageCauses and how much base damage is dealt for each. |
| SequentialModifierStep | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | Value between 0.0-1.0. Each additional hit from a single ability will have its damage reduced by this much as a percentage. All damage dealt in interaction chains forked by a Selector interaction will share the number of hits across all targets. |
| SequentialModifierMinimum | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | Value between 0.0-1.0. `SequentialModifierStep` cannot reduce damage below this percentage regardless of the number of hits. |
| RandomPercentageModifier | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | A random value between +/- this amount multiplied by the base damage will be added to the base damage. |

| Knockback | `Knockback` | **No** | The properties of the knockback that will be applied. |
| CameraEffect | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `CameraEffect`) | **No** | CameraEffect to briefly apply locally to the Target entity if they are a player. |
| StaminaDrainMultiplier | `Float`<br />(Default: 1.0) | **No** | This multiplier is applied to the stamina cost incurred by the target blocking, if any. |

**AngledDamage Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| AngleDistance | `Float`<br />(Default: 0) | **No** | The width in degrees of the matching arc around the Target entity. If the attack against the Target originates from within the arc, then the properties below will be applied to the attack, if provided. |
| Angle | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | The angle in degrees around the Target entity at which the matching arc is centered. |
| DamageCalculator | `DamageCalculator` | **No** | If provided and the attack against the Target entity originates from within the provided arc, this DamageCalculator will override the interaction's `DamageCalculator` field. |
| DamageEffects | `DamageEffects` | **No** | If provided and the attack against the Target entity originates from within the provided arc, this DamageEffects will override the interaction's `DamageEffects` field. |
| Next | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | If provided and the attack against the Target entity originates from within the provided arc, this Interaction will override the interaction's `Next` field. |

**TargetedDamage Fields** 

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| DamageCalculator | `DamageCalculator` | **No** | If provided and this TargetedDamage was matched, this DamageCalculator will override the interaction's `DamageCalculator` field and the `DamageCalculator` field of any matching `AngledDamage`. |
| DamageEffects | `DamageEffects` | **No** | If provided and this TargetedDamage was matched, this DamageEffects will override the interaction's `DamageEffects` field and the `DamageEffects` field of any matching `AngledDamage`. |
| Next | `Asset`<br />(Asset Type: `Interaction`) | **No** | If provided and this TargetedDamage was matched, this Interaction will override the interaction's `Next` field and the `Next` field of any matching `AngledDamage`. |

**EntityStatOnHit Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| EntityStatId | `Asset`<br />(AssetType: `EntityStatType`) | **Yes** | Which entity stat to affect. |
| Amount | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.0) | **No** | How much of the stat to apply for each damage application. Use negative numbers to reduce stats. |
| MultipliersPerEntitiesHit | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `Float`, Default: `[1.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1]`) | **No** | The diminishing returns curve to be applied for multiple damage applications by the same ability. Each hit's stat impact will be multiplied by the next value in the list.  If there are more hits than array elements, subsequent hits will be multiplied by `MultiplierPerExtraEntityHit`. |
| MultiplierPerExtraEntityHit | `Float`<br />(Default: 0.05) | **No** | If an ability carries out more damage applications than there are elements in the `MultipliersPerEntitiesHit` array, then subsequent stat values will be multiplied by this number. |

**Knockback Fields**

### UseEntity

This interaction is not in use by Hypixel and has some unusual qualities that mean it probably won't do what you want it
  to.  Do not use it.

This interaction will retrieve the entity currently targeted by the client (NOT the interaction chain's current Target 
  entity) and execute that entity's RootInteraction for this interaction chain's current interaction type. The 
  RootInteraction will be executed as part of this current interaction chain. None of the properties of this interaction 
  chain will be modified.

This interaction will fail if the client is not currently targeting an entity, or if no interaction for the current 
  interaction type exists on the entity.

## Farming 

These are interaction types built to support the in-game farming system in Hytale. They are mostly block-related interactions 
  with a few exceptions.

### ChangeFarmingStage

If the target block is a farming block, this interaction will attempt to modify the current farming stage in one of 
  three ways.  The interaction can optionally specify which StageSet to use for the new stage. If it is not specified, 
  the current StageSet will be used. If any part of the the process of changing the growth stage fails, this interaction 
  will fail, with the one exception that attempting to set the stage to the crop's existing stage will have no effect but 
  still succeed. 

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| UserLatestTarget | `Boolean`<br />(Default: false) | **No** | If true, update this interaction chain's target block from the client's current cursor position before executing the interaction. |
| StageSet | `String` | **No** | If provided, set the block's current stage to one in the provided StageSet. Otherwise, use the crop's current StageSet. |
| Increase | `Integer` | **No** | If provided, increase the current stage by the specified amount. If the specified stage does not exist, the block will be set to the closest extant stage. |
| Decrease | `Integer` | **No** | If provided and `Increase` is not provided, decrease the current stage by the specified amount. If the specified stage does not exist, the block will be set to the closest extant stage. |
| Stage | `Integer`<br />(Default: -1) | **No** | If provided and `Increase`/`Decrease` are not provided, set the current stage to the specified stage. If this value is less than 0, set the current stage to the final growth stage. If the specified stage does not exist, the block will be set to the closest extant stage. |


### FertilizeSoil

If the target block is unfertilized tilled soil or a farming block on top of unfertilized tilled soil, fertilizes the soil.
  The interaction will fail otherwise.

**FertilizeSoil Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required? | Notes |

| RefreshModifiers | `Array`<br />(Element Type: `String`) | **No** | Does nothing. |


### HarvestCrop

This interaction will attempt to execute the harvest action on the current block target and add the crop's drops to the User entity's
  inventory.  The block will either be destroyed or set to its post-harvest growth stage, depending on the farming 
  configuration of the block.  This will happen (and the player will receive the full harvest drops) regardless of the 
  block's current growth stage. This interaction has no special failure conditions, even if the block target isn't a 
  farming block or gathering isn't permitted in the current world, but nothing will occur in those cases.
