Now that you've created your mod, it's time to share it with the world! There are many marketplaces that allow you to publish your mod, such as Modtale, CurseForge, BuiltByBit, etc. 

We have compiled guides to publish for each marketplace, so you can easily get your mod out there and into the hands of players, no matter the marketplace they use.

- [Publishing on CurseForge](./publishing/curseforge)
