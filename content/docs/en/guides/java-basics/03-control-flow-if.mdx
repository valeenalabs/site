title: 03 - Control Flow If Statements
description: Learn how to control the flow of your Java programs using if statements.

Programs need to make decisions. If statements let your code choose different paths based on conditions.

## Basic If Statement

The simplest form checks one condition:

```java
int health = 20;

if (health > 10) {
    System.out.println("You are healthy!");
}
```

### Structure

```java
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

## If-Else Statements

Choose between two paths:

```java
int health = 5;

if (health > 10) {
    System.out.println("You are healthy!");
} else {
    System.out.println("You need healing!");
}
```

## If-Else Else-If Chain

Check multiple conditions in sequence:

```java

int health = 7;

if (health > 15) {
    System.out.println("You are in great shape!");
} else if (health > 5) {
    System.out.println("You are okay.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You need healing!");
}
```

## Nested If Statements

You can place if statements inside other if statements:

```java
int health = 12;

if (health > 10) {
    if (health > 15) {
        System.out.println("You are in great shape!");
    } else {
        System.out.println("You are healthy!");
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("You need healing!");
}
```

## Compound Conditions

You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators:

```java

// AND - both must be true
int health = 12;
boolean hasPotion = true;

if (health > 10 && hasPotion) {
    System.out.println("You are healthy and have a potion!");
} else if (health > 10) {
    System.out.println("You are healthy but need a potion!");
} else {
    System.out.println("You need healing!");
}

// OR - at least one must be true

int health = 8;
boolean hasPotion = false;
if (health > 10 || hasPotion) {
    System.out.println("You are either healthy or have a potion!");
} else {
    System.out.println("You need healing and a potion!");
}

// NOT - reverses the condition

int health = 8;
if (!(health > 10)) {
    System.out.println("You need healing!");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are healthy!");
}
```

## Ternary Operator

A compact way to assign values:

```java
int health = 12;
String status = (health > 10) ? "Healthy" : "Needs Healing";
```

### Syntax

```java
variable = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```
