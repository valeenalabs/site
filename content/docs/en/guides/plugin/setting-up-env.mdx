This guide will walk you through setting up a complete development environment for Hytale modding, including all necessary tools and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- A computer running Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- At least 8GB of RAM
- 10GB of free disk space
- Administrative privileges on your system

## Required Software

### 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

Hytale modding requires Java 25 or later. We recommend using OpenJDK.

#### Windows
1. Download OpenJDK 25 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
2. Run the installer with default settings
3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and running:
```bash
java -version
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install openjdk@25
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-25-jdk
```

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

We recommend IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition for Hytale modding.

1. Download from [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
2. Install with default settings
3. Launch and complete the initial setup wizard

### 3. Maven

1. Visit the official website: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi  
2. Download this file: `apache-maven-3.9.12-bin.zip` (Binary zip archive)
3. Unzip it 
4. Add the `apache-maven-3.9.12/bin/` folder to your PATH

You can now try the command `mvn -version` to verify Maven is installed correctly. Make sure to do this in a fresh new terminal instead of one you had opened from before!

## Setting Up Your Workspace

### 1. Clone the Plugin Template

Instead of creating an empty directory, we'll use the official Hytale plugin template:

```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/HytaleModding/plugin-template.git MyFirstMod
cd MyFirstMod
```

### 2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Click "Open" and navigate to your `MyFirstMod` directory
3. IntelliJ will automatically detect it as a Maven project
4. Wait for the project to index and dependencies to download

### 3. Add HytaleServer.jar Dependency

Before you can start modding, you need to add the HytaleServer.jar file as a dependency:

1. **Download HytaleServer.jar** using the [Hytale Downloader](https://support.hytale.com/hc/en-us/articles/45326769420827-Hytale-Server-Manual)
2. **Add to IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Click on **"File"** at the top left
   - Go to **"Project Structure"**
   - Go to **"Libraries"**
   - Click on the **+ icon**
   - Select the **HytaleServer.jar** you downloaded

### 4. Add the HytaleServer to your Artifacts

<Callout type="warning">
This is a temporary workaround until Hypixel provides an official Maven repository for HytaleServer.jar
</Callout>

Run this command in your console

```bash
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=[ROUTE TO HytaleServer.jar] -DgroupId=com.hypixel.hytale -DartifactId=HytaleServer-parent -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar
```

Replace `[ROUTE TO HytaleServer.jar]` with the actual path to the `HytaleServer.jar` file on your system.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your development environment set up with the plugin template:

1. **Customize the template** - Edit the `pom.xml` and `manifest.json` file to change your mod's name and details
2. **Explore the code structure** - Familiarize yourself with the template's organization
3. **Start modding** - Begin writing your first Hytale plugin!
