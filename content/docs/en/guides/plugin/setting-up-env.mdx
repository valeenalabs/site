This guide will walk you through setting up a complete development environment for Hytale modding, including all necessary tools and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- A computer running Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- At least 8GB of RAM
- 10GB of free disk space
- Administrative privileges on your system

## Required Software

### 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

Hytale modding requires Java 25 or later. We recommend using OpenJDK.

#### Windows
1. Download OpenJDK 25 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
2. Run the installer with default settings
    - Optionally enable feature `Set or Override JAVA_HOME variable` to resolve version related build issues with your project.
3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and running:
```bash
java -version
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install openjdk@25
```

<Callout type="info">
If `java --version` shows "Unable to locate a Java Runtime", add OpenJDK to your PATH:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/openjdk@25/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
</Callout>

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-25-jdk
```

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

We recommend IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition for Hytale modding.

1. Download from [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
2. Install with default settings
3. Launch and complete the initial setup wizard

### 3. Java Build Tool
We recommend using Apache Maven for managing dependencies and building your Hytale plugins. (Alternatively you can use Gradle, but this guide focuses on Maven.)

1. Visit the official website: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. Download this file: `apache-maven-3.9.12-bin.zip` (Binary zip archive)
3. Unzip it
4. Add the `apache-maven-3.9.12/bin/` folder to your PATH

You can now try the command `mvn -version` to verify Maven is installed correctly. Make sure to do this in a fresh new terminal instead of one you had opened from before!

## Setting Up Your Workspace

### 1. Clone the Plugin Template

Instead of creating an empty directory, we'll use the official Hytale plugin template:

```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/HytaleModding/plugin-template.git MyFirstMod
cd MyFirstMod
```

If you don't have Git installed, you can download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it to a folder named `MyFirstMod`.

### 2. Open Plugin in your IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Click "Open" and navigate to your `MyFirstMod` directory
3. IntelliJ will automatically detect it as a Maven project
4. Wait for the project to index and dependencies to download

<Callout type="info">
    We recommend following [this](https://gist.github.com/TheNullicorn/90a619796c40f20ae1fcf13094c1a57d) guide to ensure you are using the correct `Nonnull` in your projects.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your development environment set up with the plugin template:

1. **Customize the template** - Edit the `pom.xml` and `manifest.json` file to change your mod's name and details
2. **Explore the code structure** - Familiarize yourself with the template's organization
3. **Start modding** - Begin writing your first Hytale plugin!

Learn how to:
   - [Build and Test Your Mod](./build-and-test)
   - [Create Commands](./creating-commands)
   - [Create Events](./creating-events)
