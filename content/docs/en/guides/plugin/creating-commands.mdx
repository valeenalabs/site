In this guide, you will learn how to create custom commands for your Hytale mod.

## The `CommandBase` Class

To create a command, you can extend the `CommandBase` class. You need to provide a constructor that calls the superclass constructor with the command name, description, and whether the command requires confirmation (--confirm while running the command).

You can override the `executeSync` function to implement the command's behavior. Here is an example of a simple command that sends a message to the command sender:

```java
public class ExampleCommand extends CommandBase {

    public ExampleCommand() {
        super("example", "A example command", false);
    }

    @Override
    protected void executeSync(@Nonnull CommandContext context) {
        context.sendMessage(Message.raw("Hello from ExampleCommand!"));
    }
}
```

## Registering the Command

For any command 

```java
public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        this.getCommandRegistry().registerCommand(new ExampleCommand());
    }
}
```
