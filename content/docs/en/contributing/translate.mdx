# Translating HytaleModding

HytaleModding is translated with the help of the community using **Crowdin**. If you want to help translate or improve existing translations, this is the right place.

## Steps to Translate

All translations are managed **via Crowdin**.

1. Visit [our Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/hytalemodding) and log in if required.
2. Click on your language.
3. Click on the file/article you wish to translate. We recommend starting with Official Documentation, and then Server Plugin Documentation.
4. Start translating!
5. Approved translations will appear on the website.

## How to discuss

You can always report issues or discuss specific topics directly on Crowdin, but we recommend using Discord instead of the Crowdin comment system to keep everything organized in one place.

1. Join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hytalemodding)
2. Open `#translations` channel. Here you can discuss or ask questions that are not related to a specific language.
3. If you want to join a thread, you are required to run `/translator <your-language>` command here. The bot will add you to the thread for your language.

## Translation Guidelines

- You need to be confident in what you are translating. You should be able to read the text you just translated and understand the meaning of it very easily.
- It should use the simplest form of language possible. Use English words if the translation is unknown to the majority in your country.
- Use your imagination, trust yourself. Feel free to change any context as you wish as long as it can still get the same point across and is understandable.
- These guidelines are more important than language-specific guidelines, but less important than Hytale terminology and rules.

## What not to translate

We request you all to not translate these specific sections of the website:

### Callout types
Callouts are the boxes that contain important information. We request you to not translate the types as they only work in English. 

**Example:**
```mdx
<Callout type="warning" title="Translate this title!">
Translate the text inside the callout!
</Callout>
```

In this example, please don't translate the word warning, the rest you can translate.

### Icons
Icon names must not be translated.
They are technical identifiers mapped directly to existing icons. Translating them will break the icon rendering.
```mdx
icon: Globe
```
