## How to discuss

You can always report issues or discuss specific topics directly on Crowdin, but we recommend to use Discord instead of the crowdin comment system to keep everything organized in one place..

1. Join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hytalemodding)
2. Open `#translation` channel. Here you can discuss or ask quesions which aren't specific for specific language.
3. If you want to join thread you are required to run `/translator <your-language>` command here. Bot will join you to thread of your language. If you can't see your language:
  - It could be not available on Crowdin. Then you may request it.
  - If you see it on Crowdin then it's missing in our bot. You may ping **Neil** and tell it.

## Translation Guidelines

- You need to be confident in what you are translating, you should be able to read the text you just translated and understand the meaning of it very easily.
- It should use the most simplest form of language possible. Use english words if the translation is unknown to the majority in your country.
- Use your imagination, trust yourself. Feel free to change any context as you wish as long as it still means the same thing and is understandable.
- These guidelines are always more important than language specific, but lower than Hytale's.

### What no to translate

We request you all to not translate these specific sections of the website:

**Callout types**
Callouts are the boxes that contain important information. We request you to not translate the types as they only work in the english language. 

**Example:**
```mdx
<Callout type="warning" title="Translate this title!">
Translate the text in between!
</Callout>
```

In this example, please don't translate the word warning, the rest you can translate.
