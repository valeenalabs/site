# Hytale Modding Documentation

**An unofficial community-maintained documentation site for Hytale modding.**

This project provides comprehensive guides, documentation, and resources for modding [Hytale](https://hytale.com/) - a voxel-based sandbox RPG game built from the ground up with modding and user-generated content at its core.

## About Hytale Modding

Hytale is designed with a server-first modding approach, allowing anyone to create and share mods without requiring players to download external client modifications. Whether you're interested in:

- **Server Plugins** - Java-based programming for deep gameplay modifications
- **Data Assets** - JSON-driven content like blocks, items, NPCs, and world generation
- **Art Assets** - Custom models, textures, and sounds using Blockbench
- **Visual Scripting** - Node-based logic for designers and non-programmers

This documentation aims to help you get started and master Hytale modding.

> Learn more about Hytale's modding strategy in the [official blog post](https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status).
